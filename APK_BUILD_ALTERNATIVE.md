# 📱 APK Build Alternative - Development Server Method

Since EAS requires interactive setup that's challenging in Termux, here's the **working solution**:

## 🚀 Method 1: Development Server (Instant Testing)

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start
```

Then on your **OnePlus 9 Pro**:
1. Install **Expo Go** from Google Play Store
2. Scan the QR code displayed in terminal
3. App will load directly on your phone for testing

## 🏗️ Method 2: Web Setup for EAS (One-time)

Since interactive prompts don't work in Termux, do this **once** from a regular terminal:

1. **On any computer with regular terminal:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GrizzlyRooster34/rork-heinicus-mobile-mechanic-app.git
   cd rork-heinicus-mobile-mechanic-app
   npm install
   eas login  # Login as heinicus1
   eas init   # Accept prompts to create project
   git add . && git commit -m "Add EAS project config"
   git push
   ```

2. **Back in Termux:**
   ```bash
   git pull  # Get the EAS config
   eas build -p android --profile development  # Will now work
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Test Solution (Recommended)

For immediate testing on your OnePlus 9 Pro:

```bash
# Option A: Development server (fastest)
npm start

# Option B: Web preview 
npm run start-web
```

## 📋 Current Status

✅ Project configured for builds  
✅ Version auto-bumping working  
✅ Native Android project generated  
✅ All dependencies installed  
⚠️ EAS needs one-time interactive setup  

## 🔧 Technical Details

Your project is **100% ready** for APK builds. The only blocker is that EAS CLI requires interactive prompts for first-time project creation, which Termux can't handle.

**Package**: `com.heinicus.mobilemechanic`  
**Version**: 1.0.0 (build 4)  
**Target**: OnePlus 9 Pro Android
