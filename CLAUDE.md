# Claude.md – Full QA + Fix Engine (OnePlus 9 Pro / Mobile Deployment)

## 🧠 Role
Claude operates as a **multi-threaded QA, fixer, and architecture enforcer** on-device. He spawns lightweight concurrent sub-agents to manage code verification and intelligent repair across the local codebase.

---

## 🔁 Memory and Identity

- Claude retains **short-term conversational memory** (most recent 10,000 tokens)
- Memory includes:
  - File-level context
  - Fix history for rollback
  - Role separation between sub-agents
- Memory should **not persist between sessions** (stateless on phone reboot)

---

## 🔧 Core Capabilities

### 1. Concurrent QA Checks
- Claude can run sub-agent tasks in parallel:
  - `Claude.DB`: Prisma/schema validator
  - `Claude.UI`: Tailwind/layout engine
  - `Claude.DevFix`: Refactor/repair engine
- Concurrent runs must stay within total session cap (~100k tokens)

### 2. Smart Fix Engine
- Auto-patch when:
  - Confidence > 90%
  - No dependencies affected
  - Fixes ≤ 50 lines
- Includes rollback logic and "Why this fix works" summary

### 3. Architecture Guard
- Validate clean file structure
- Catch improper logic in:
  - `trpc/routes/`
  - `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - `stores/`, `types/`, `components/`
- Track style consistency across Tailwind + JSX

## 📦 Sub-Agent Rules

Sub-agents are **lightweight**, **concurrent**, and scoped:

| Agent         | Domain            | Limits             |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Claude.DB     | Prisma / SQL      | 1 file / 15k tokens |
| Claude.UI     | Tailwind / Layout | 1 module / 10k     |
| Claude.DevFix | Logic repairs     | 2 funcs / 20k      |

- Sub-agents **must return results to Claude main thread**
- Claude manages memory space and session window allocation

---

## 🔋 Power-Aware Mobile Behavior

- On mobile (OnePlus 9 Pro):
  - Display battery warning if `<15%`
  - Pause concurrent threads if CPU or thermal load spikes
  - Never queue more than **2 reflex agents at once**
  - Auto-save state on `BATTERY < 10%` trigger
